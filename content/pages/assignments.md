### Civic Design Skill Assessment \[Individual Effort\]

Using the {{% resource_link bd22d7eb-135c-d028-02e8-d8469230272c "Civic Design Framework Grid (PDF)" %}}, conduct a one-on-one interview with a person of your choice (we will develop criteria in the class). This assessment will ask people to rate their knowledge/skill for each of the 48 design challenges represented in the framework. Instructions for the exercise will be provided in class. \[15% of grade\]

### Design Briefs \[Team Effort\] 

The brief is a document that assists a specific client in the design of a public engagement effort. Each design will consider the following questions:

1.  Which of the six conversation types introduced during the first part of the class to include;
2.  Which three design principles should be prioritized to engage the broadest spectrum of the public; and
3.  What activities and processes to use in the engagement process?

The finished products will include a design brief for the client, a blog post on the design brief, and a personal reflection on the experience of creating the design brief. The brief includes exercises for learning about the different principles devised from the Learning Design products. \[40% of grade\]

Sample design briefs from 2020 and previous years:
